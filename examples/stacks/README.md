# examples/stacks

Examples that depend on a specific stack or version (e.g., React 18, React Router v7, TypeScript v5, Vite/Webpack).

Layers:
- base — minimal, stack‑common rules
- vX — additional rules per major/minor versions
- tooling — bundlers and related integrations

Most examples have been consolidated under `stacks/` and `recipes/`; legacy `examples/policies/*` has been removed.
