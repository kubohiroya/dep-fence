# examples/recipes

Task-oriented, copy‑pasteable combinations. Each recipe names its prerequisites (common/stacks) and includes a `DEP_FENCE_CONFIG=...` run example.

Examples:
- publishable-local-shims — temporary local .d.ts shims policy
- package-types-dist — pin `types` and `exports[entry].types` to `dist/*.d.ts`
- multi-entry-workers — combine multi-entry with JS‑only worker subpaths
